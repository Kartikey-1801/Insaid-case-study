# Product Feature design
In this project, I designed a dedicated lyrics tab and section for a music mobile app using Figma. The goal was to enhance the user experience by providing easy access to song lyrics, making it more immersive for users who like to sing along or understand the meaning behind the music. I explored multiple design options, analyzing user needs and interface usability, before selecting the final design. Key decisions were informed by thorough research on industry trends, user behavior, and the importance of integrating lyrics seamlessly into the music streaming experience. The final design balances functionality and aesthetics, ensuring a visually appealing interface that maintains ease of navigation.
